# Description of the project

The project is an object-oriented program 
named _Expression Calculator_. The program takes 
an expression as an input, and produce the result 
of calculation. The design of class hierarchy representing 
syntax for expressions is implemented as shown in slides.
 In the program you will find functionality for parsing 
 expression and building _AST_, as well as test cases for testing 
 program. Also expression calculation is implemented as 
 tree traversal.
 
 # Dependencies

The project uses _gradle_ for test cases so your system should 
support that, as well as _java sdk 1.8_.
